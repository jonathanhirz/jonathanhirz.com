I make games. Rather, I try to in my **wealth** of free time. My wife & son & full time job keep me pretty busy, but my dream has always been to make something that I can put out in the world. I used to look at computer programming as a silly side hobby, writing code to make the computer do silly things. In the last few years though, the channels to put content into people's hands have been thrown wide open, and the hobby programmer can feasibly make a living in their living room with these skills.

I have no formal training in Computer Science. Everything I have learned has been through trial and error and by gathering resources online. With those skills I am focused on making games with ~~Unity~~ HaxeFlixel for mobile and PC/Mac/Linux.

I spent a lot of *wasted* time trying out different frameworks for making games. There are too many to list here, and all of them have their pros and cons. Ultimately, I want it all: a powerful cross-platform game framework with great documentation and support. I want to write my code once in my favorite editor (Sublime Text) and be able to deploy to every computer/OS/mobile/console out there. Also, it should be free. Not too much to ask, right?

[HaxeFlixel](http://haxeflixel.com) hits almost all of those marks. In fact, it hits enough that I really feel comfortable moving forward and devoting the time to it. Docs and tutorials are there, and growing. The only platform not currently supported is the next-gen consoles like PS4/Vita and XBONE, etc. I hope that when I am making games that are up the quality needed to be on those consoles, the support will be there. For now, I am happy with web, desktop and mobile.

I crossed out Unity above because I was using it for a while, and spent a few months learning the ins and out of that system. I feel like Unity is 'too much' for me right now, and comes with a lot of overhead that I don't need. Also, it costs a fortune for someone who just does this for fun. We will see, in the future it may be the perfect tool for me, because it really is an amazing tool for making games.
