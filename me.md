Tools & Skills: Unity (JavaScript & C#), iOS (Objective-C), Web (PHP, HTML, CSS, JS) & HaxeFlixel (Haxe).

I make games. Rather, I try to make games in my **wealth** of free time. My wife & son & full time job keep me pretty busy, but my dream has always been to make something that I can put out in the world. I used to look at computer programming as a silly side hobby, writing code to make the computer do things. In the last few years though, the channels to put content into people's hands have been thrown wide open, and the hobby programmer can feasibly make a living from home with these skills.

I have no formal training in Computer Science. Everything I have learned has been through trial and error and by gathering resources online. With those skills I am focused on making games with (Unity || HaxeFlixel) for mobile platforms and PC/Mac/Linux.

I have spent a lot of time trying out different frameworks for making games. There are too many to list here, and all of them have their pros and cons. Ultimately, I want it all: a powerful cross-platform game framework with great documentation and support. I want to write my code once in my favorite editor (Sublime Text) and be able to deploy to every computer/OS/mobile/console out there. Also, it should be free. Not too much to ask, right? For now, I am settling between Unity and HaxeFlixel, learning both systems as I go and using the appropriate tool for the job.
