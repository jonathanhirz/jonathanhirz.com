<a href="/crashPlan">crashPlan</a> - I built this last month but kind of forgot about it. This was my attempt at a 'flappy' clone <b>in spaaaace!</b> No collision detection yet but you can tap space to burst up a little bit and pretend to avoid the asteroids. [19 Apr 2014]

<a href="/jumper">Jumper</a> - I had an idea to make a 3D "Doodle Jump" where you are staring down and bouncing on platforms...it's not very fun, but here's my quick prototype. [15 Mar 2014]

<a href="http://jonathanhirz.com/2013/10/15/shieldefense-is-the-next-game-that-i-think-i-will/">shielDefense</a> (temporary title) - Nothing playable has been released yet, but I have a prototype of this game built and running on my phone. It was made with <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org">cocos2d</a>, but my plan is to remake and eventually finish this game with Unity.
