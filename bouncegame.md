A slight extension of 'bounceTest', now you have to avoid the spikes on the floor and jump to randomly spawning platforms. And get a high score! Fun =]

Still in 'prototype' mode for these games, I don't want to spend a lot of time on polish. I did add some graphics and sounds to this one though just to test that out. Love how easy HaxeFlixel makes all of this.
