I make games. Rather, I try to make games in my **wealth** of free time. My wife, son & full time job keep me pretty busy, but my dream has always been to make something that I can put out in the world. I used to look at computer programming as a silly side hobby, writing code to make the computer do things. In the last few years though, the channels to put content into people's hands have been thrown wide open, and the hobby programmer can feasibly make a living from home with these skills.

I have no formal training in Computer Science. Everything I have learned has been self taught through trial and error and by gathering resources online. With those skills I am focused on making games with (HaxeFlixel || Unity) for mobile platforms and PC/Mac/Linux.
