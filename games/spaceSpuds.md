spaceSpuds - a Flaplike in SPACE!<br />

spaceSpuds is a quick to learn but hard to master game that's great for wasting a few minutes on. Fly through space and dodge the spud-looking asteroids. Currently available for Windows and OS X, soon to be released on iOS as well.

-Controls-
Simple controls are the best. One button will boost your ship up, and when you let go you will fall back down. Use any key on your keyboard, the left mouse button, or if you have a Playstation 3 Dualshock controller hooked up to your system, you can use the 'X' button.

-Credits-
I made this game in my spare time while working a full time job and being a good husband and father at home. I couldn't have done it without the work that many others put into the tools that I use. I make my games with [HaxeFlixel](http://haxeflixel.com), a wonderful cross-platform 2D game engine. All graphic assets are courtesy of [Kenney](http://kenney.nl), who makes tons of free art for developers who lack the skills. The background music was made with [Figure for iOS](https://www.propellerheads.se/products/figure/), and the sound effects were made with [Bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/).
