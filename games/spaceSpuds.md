Updated version of 'crashPlan'. I need to change the name, and my wife thinks the asteroids look like potatoes, so we came up with spaceSpuds. Works for now.

Click to gain focus, then tap SPACE to boost up. Dodge as many asteroids as you can and go for the high score.

Improvements over the last version...not too much. Ship is a little more floaty, I added some sweet engine particle effects too. Once I have the GUI done and I balance the asteroid spawn rate, I'll be releasing this on iOS (for now). I would love to make some money off of this, but I don't know if many would pay even $0.99 for this. I wonder if there's a way to monetize with IAPs? Maybe I need some pickups and upgrades...

...I should put this in a blog post, but I really hate that gaming has come to require this type of thinking for developers. I would love to just make a game, a simple arcade style high score chaser, and sell it for money. Those are they games that I like to play, so those are the games that I should make. So that's what I'm going to do. If you want to play the game for free, check out my site and play the web version. No ads. If you want to support a developer, you can buy the game for a buck on your iThing. I might even put a desktop version on itch.io as PWYW.
