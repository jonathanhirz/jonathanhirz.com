<p><a href="http://jonathanhirz.com/spaceGame" title="spaceGame">spaceGame</a>Â is the second Walker Boy Studio tutorial game that I recently finished. This game is obviously more fun and complicated than the first<em> game</em>, and sets up a lot of things I will need for shielDefense. The premise is simple, move the ship to dodge the asteroids, or shoot them to gain a point. Get hit three times and you die. Raise your shields for extra protection, and if you make it through the time limit without dying, you win! Personally I would have designed the gameplay a little differently, and will be exploring that a lot when I start my new project. It&#8217;s one thing to code a game, but it&#8217;s a completely different beast to design and define what a game is and how it&#8217;s played. I think about it constantly, and I&#8217;m always going back and forth about it.</p>
<p>I am actually really excited to start working on shielDefense, and have a good idea of how to attack it. Unity3d really makes making games easy, but I feel like it isn&#8217;t limiting in any way&#8230;yet. I&#8217;m sure some can argue that for certain larger scale games it isn&#8217;t the best option, but for a beginning indie game developer, it really is an amazing tool.</p>
