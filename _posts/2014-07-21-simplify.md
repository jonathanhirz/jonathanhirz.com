It's only been two weeks since I launched the Patreon and this new venture into making money with indie games. Some would say this isn't long enough to really test the waters, but I feel like if it didn't take off right away, why let it stagnant? If it didn't have a good push from the beginning, I would feel bad taking money from one or two people each month. My motivation for making games should come from me, and I think going back to basics is what I need to do right now. I am extremely grateful for the **one guy** from Australia, [@charcoal](http://twitter.com/charcoal) who donated a few bucks to my cause. That day was really cool when I saw that email, and I thought this thing was taking off. I have codes for all my future games ear marked for him just for that.

So...simplify. I still like the idea of having free games on my website for people to play, but I think I will just use [itch.io](http://itch.io) for now as a way to sell games. I'm not sure if I will have a pay what you want option or a minimum price, it will depend on the project. Also, I would love to have games on iOS again, but I will have to raise some funds to renew the developer subscription.
