title: A small recap

Remember [this post](http://jonathanhirz.com/2013/12/18/macprotrash-icon/) from December of 2013? I made a little trash can icon for OS X and posted about it on my blog, and had a little laugh. Well, today I thought I would look through my website's stats in cPanel, because I was curious how many people had downloaded that little file.

**74,924**

To this day, exactly three months after posting, almost 75,000 people have downloaded something I made. 1,500 downloads this month alone.

I really should have monetized that thing. =]
