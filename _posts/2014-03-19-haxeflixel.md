title: HaxeFlixel
---

So I have changed my mind again, and I have decided to really learn and give HaxeFlixel a chance. I think the benefit of using free tools outweighs the potential benefits that Unity has. I want to keep Unity on the back burner, because it is a very powerful tool that I someday hope to use. But for now, a simpler set of tools with a smaller footprint feels right.

The main thing I look for in a game making tool set is cross platform output with a single code base. HaxeFlixel can output to web, Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS and Android, plus some miscellaneous others. Console deployment is supposedly something that could come someday. I hope it does, because being able to have a game on Vita or Playstation would be AMAZING!
