I think I will let my Apple Developer account finally expire this May. I have spent three years and $300 in this program with a simple goal of making back the money I put into it. I have not done that. I think over the three years I made about $50 from the two apps I released. Not quite worth it at the time to keep that account open.

For now and the foreseeable future, I will be focusing on making games using free tools and distribution channels. I see huge potential with HaxeFlixel and what I can make with it, and I think I can make some money selling through itch.io or maybe flash portals. Ouya is another option I am considering, but for now I just want to make fun games and not bleed any more money.

I figure I need to conserve what money I have for my family for now, and use whatever I can make to invest further in tools and dev subscriptions. But if I have a great idea for a mobile game I would love to jump back into Apple land and launch on iOS first.
