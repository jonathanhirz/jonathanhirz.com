I was looking for a plugin to easily embed Unity 3d web output files into my Jekyll blog (see example [here](/games/crashPlan)). I was using the default pages, and they work fine but kind of break the flow of the site when someone plays them. I couldn't find a plugin, so I thought I'd look into making one. Uh...not going to happen! I didn't want to learn Ruby just for this little plugin (a couple of years ago that might have been a fun weekend project, but I just don't have the time or energy anymore). So, my other option was to somehow wedge the template into Jekyll (more specifically [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) in this case). I would love to go into detail of how I did this, but I have to go to work in 6 hours, and I need some sleep. Check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/jonathanhirz/jonathanhirz.com/) for this site, specifically the new [default-unity](https://github.com/jonathanhirz/jonathanhirz.com/blob/master/_layouts/default-unity.html), [head-unity](https://github.com/jonathanhirz/jonathanhirz.com/blob/master/_includes/head-unity.html) and [unityPage](https://github.com/jonathanhirz/jonathanhirz.com/blob/master/_layouts/unityPage.html) files. Basically just taking the default templates and smashing it into the header and body where Jekyll builds from. It also grabs the *.unity3d file name from the title of the page and loads the correct one. The only caveat for now is games are set at 640x480 resolution, but this would be easy to make variable. You would just have to have that info in the YAML front matter on each game page then load it into the script.
