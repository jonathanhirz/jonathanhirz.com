title: New direction for shielDefense (maybe a name change too)
category: dev

One hard lesson I am learning in game development is that sometimes the idea in your head isn’t fun. It sounds like it will work and be fun, but once you actually get a prototype running and start playing, it just doesn’t work. I realized the main mechanism for my game (bouncing/aiming asteroids off of a shield) just isn’t fun. And that’s ok! I fought for a couple of days to tweak things and try and make it fun, but it just never felt right.

Before scraping this project and moving on though, I am going to try a bigger change to the core mechanic and see how that goes. Already it feels more fun, but needs a little more finishing before I can decide. Instead of bouncing asteroids, the shield will now catch a few of them, maybe 5, and have them orbit the ship. Then these can be used as projectiles that can be fired out at an aimed direction. Check out these two videos:

They show off a little of what I am trying out, one with a TON of asteroids being collected and one with only a few. Obviously a little buggy, but aiming the asteroids with the right stick feels very fun. I think firing them with R1 on a controller would be perfect, but of course this brings up another problem of controls on a touch screen. Not sure how that would work, maybe swipe to fire, or dragging a larger distance to fire.
