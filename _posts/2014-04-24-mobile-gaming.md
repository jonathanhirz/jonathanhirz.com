title: I think I need a break from mobile gaming
---

I love games, and I love gaming (when I have the time). And the recent explosion of mobile gaming with smartphones is very exciting as a gamer and a developer. But sadly I have been so unmotivated lately with games that are coming out, and I find it hard to get into most games. My biggest gripe is with control schemes. I HATE on screen controls, and I find most button imitations to be impossible to use. Even the compromised control schemes (swipe from anywhere to move, tap to attack, etc) aren't perfect. I feel like I need physical buttons under my thumbs to be able to get into the game more without constantly readjusting my controls.

My other gripe with touch screen gaming is when my thumbs block action on the screen. This happens more with roguelikes where you tap to move. I would just rather play a game with a controller, and I am not going to spend $100 on a controller hook up for my iPhone. So, random point of this post, I think I'll finally dust off my 3DS and play Bravely Default, or my PSPgo and play one of the many RPGs I have waiting for me there.

//update - Here's a list of games that I really enjoy on iOS that have *unique* or useable control schemes:

- Threes
- Out There
- Year Walk
- Device 6
- Polymer
- Pivvot
- Super Hexagon
- Chillaxian
- Spelltower
- Super Splatform

This is far from a complete list of well controlled mobile games, rather just a quick set of examples. I enjoy games that either have touch controls that feel like you're directly interacting with the world (Year Walk, Device 6) or games that reduce the controls to simply one or two buttons that can be accessed in large, non-specific areas of the screen. Chillaxian and Super Splatform do this so well, the screen is split in half and either side is a large 'button', though there aren't any graphical queues for this, the buttons are just the play screen.
