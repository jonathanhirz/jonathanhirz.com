I made another quicky game in HaxeFlixel, which you can play [here](/games/bouncegame). I'm posting all of these small games that I make for a few reasons. First, it's good practice to show off your progress. I think other devs like to see this stuff, and it's encouraging to others who are learning. Nobody produces their finest work on the first try, so I kind of like showing off these little crappy projects. Second, I like the idea of someday having a well documented timeline of my gamedev career, and a way to look back at the progress I have made. This site is all about that; sharing my adventure in this crazy game.
