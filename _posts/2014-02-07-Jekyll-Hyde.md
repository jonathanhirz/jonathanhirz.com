title: Jekyll &amp; Hyde
---

Here it is. My new site. I am not using Wordpress anymore in favor of a static generated site powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with the awesome [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme. I won't go too far into why I picked Jekyll, at least not until a future post.

I added my old posts from Wordpress, but I haven't cleaned them all up yet. I did make sure to fix up the [Mac Pro Trash Icon](http://jonathanhirz.com/2013/12/18/macprotrash-icon/) post since that was still getting some traffic pre-hack.

Once I have some more time I'll go through the old posts and clean them up, re add images, and then back to blogging and programming!
