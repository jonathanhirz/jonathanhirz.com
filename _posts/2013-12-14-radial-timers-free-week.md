title: raDial Timer's Free Week

Last week I set raDial Timer to free in the App Store, just to see what would happen. I honestly didn't expect too much, but it's always fun to play around with these apps and try to reach more people.

If you are familiar with iTunes Connect or Flurry, these charts will make sense to you. I saw a small spike in new users &amp; downloads on the first day, but never really reaching more than a couple hundred downloads. So far, there have been zero sales after the free promotion. Nothing spectacular, but honestly I wasn't expecting much. This app was more of a design challenge for me, and taking an idea that's in my head and making it happen is worth the effort put in.

I may have been able to promote this free week a little better. A single tweet doesn't really cut it these days, but my wife and I had a baby this week so that kind of took over our lives recently. Obviously no complaints, I'm happy to have a new little man in my life. =]
