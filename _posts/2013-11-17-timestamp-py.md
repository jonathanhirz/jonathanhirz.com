<p>I wanted a way to easily and automatically add a timestamp to my script files created in Unity. Along with an author line, it gives them a little bit of professionalism and helps future me if I ever need to look back at some source code. Maybe.. not sure why I would need to know the exact date and time that a file was created and last modified, but hopefully a few hours of learning Sublime Text plugin scripting will pay off.Â </p>
<p>So, <a href="https://gist.github.com/jonathanhirz/7507767">this Python Script</a>, when installed correctly in Sublime Text 2, will automatically create and update time stamps in your code. Fun! All you need is to add a few lines to your template files so the proper triggers are in place, and the rest happens automatically.</p>
<p>I had a huge head start from the plugin posted in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=9093">this forum thread</a>, but being my first plugin I think I did pretty good.</p>
