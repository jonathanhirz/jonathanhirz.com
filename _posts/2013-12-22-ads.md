During the <em>massive</em> spike in traffic I saw a few days ago, I kept thinking that I should have put ads on and tried to make a little extra money. I was a little late, and got them up on the second day. I still saw about 6,500 hits that day, and about half that the following days. I thought that was pretty decent, but that translates to only about $0.12 in ad revenue. Wah wah...I guess you need a million hits a day to make having ads worthwhile.

Anyway, back to the clean site for now. I like it better this way.
