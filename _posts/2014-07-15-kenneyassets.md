title: Kenney's Asset Pack
---

I wanted to make a post about a great resource for start up developers who might be great coders and designers, but lack skills in art (just like me). I can't draw...at all. I can manipulate images in Pixelmator and do some basic tweaks, but the creation part of art is really hard for me. I was **amazed** when I found the work of [Kenney](http://www.kenney.nl), a game developer from The Netherlands who also creates [asset packs](http://kenney.itch.io/kenney-donation) for developers. The amazing thing is that he releases them FOR FREE through [itch.io](http://itch.io). I have been using his assets for a while in my demo/learning projects, and the quality is really high. There are so many different sprites and backgrounds that you really can make anything with them, and they are organized well too. I finally decided to kick Kenney $5 and get the full pack, but his work really is worth more than that. I plan to donate more as I use his assets in more projects and as more money (hopefully) comes my way through my Patreon campaign (one backer so far!) and through itch.io. So check him out!
