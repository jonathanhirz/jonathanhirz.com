title: shielDefense demo/prototype/proof of concept

If you have a controller hooked up to your PC, you can try out the prototype of a new game that I have been working on <a href="http://jonathanhirz.com/games/shielDefense">RIGHT HERE</a>. This is a super bare bones version of what I want to make, focusing on the core gameplay element only. No fancy graphics, no sound, no real point yet except to test if the game would be fun. So check it out.

I emphasize the need for a controller because keyboard controls will just not work for this game. I have them enabled for testing (you can still move the ship with the arrow keys, but that's it), but this game requires a twin stick controller to play correctly. So, I apologize if you don't have a controller handy.

I have three visions for this game, each escalating in complexity. Time and interest will determine how far I take this project. First, this could be a simple Asteroids clone with the new shooting mechanic. Large asteroids could be broken down by firing smaller ones at them, then smaller asteroids destroyed for points. You die if you get hit enough times when your shields are down.

The second vision is a single player expanded version that has a back story and enemy ships that you need to fight. The very short version is that your ship somehow has lost its weapons capabilities, but your onboard scientist has been able to reconfigure your shields for use as a weapon. You can catch the small asteroids that float around and fling them towards your enemies to destroy them. The downside is that when you are holding asteroids, your shields won't protect you. I like this idea because it gives the game some balance, as you have to manage gathering projectiles and using them quickly before you get hit by the enemy.

The third vision I have is to take the single player core gameplay, and add multiplayer combat. There is a resurgence of 'couch multiplayer' games right now, specifically focusing on these battle style games that bring back memories of Street Fighter and Smash Brothers. Towerfall is a huge hit, Samurai Gunn released to huge success, and Nidhogg is coming soon too. This type of gameplay could be really fun, but would need a LOT of extra content besides just flinging asteroids.

But for now, I have a core gameplay proof of concept and a dream. Feel free to play around and send me any feedback you have. You can comment on this post, reach me on twitter or send me an email. Thanks!
