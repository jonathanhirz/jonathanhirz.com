<p>Definitely renewing my iOS developer membership today. WWDC always inspires me and reinvigorates my passion for what Apple does. I thought I wanted to explore other platforms. I thought buttons and joysticks mattered&#8230;well they do for certain games. And I still may make that game for Vita, but really, do be serious about this, iOS is the way to go.</p>
