title: Unity + Futile, or HaxeFlixel?
category: dev
---
I started messing around with <a href="https://github.com/MattRix/Futile">Futile</a> yesterday after a few days of deciding which framework to go ahead with. I have really been debating between <a href="http://haxeflixel.com">HaxeFlixel</a> and Unity + Futile for a number of reasons, and didn't want to move too far forward until I knew which I wanted to use. I really like both because they allow for cross platform deployment. This is <strong>HUGE</strong> to me because it means less work in getting my games out to as many people/platforms as possible. Code once, deploy everywhere.

HaxeFlixel is appealing because it is all code based, has tons of gamedev focused features, and is able to be run all out of <a href="http://sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>, which is my all time favorite text/code editor for many reasons. That program makes me happy to write code. The downsides are a smaller community of developers, and not knowing really how powerful the engine is. There are tons of small demos and a few games made with HaxeFlixel, but I haven't seen what it can really do, and I worry I'll hit a wall at some point.

Unity on the other hand, seems limitless. It has proven to be a very powerful engine, and has all the platform options that HaxeFlixel offers, plus a few more. I dream of making a game for a console one day, and Unity keeps that option open for me. I love the addition of Futile to the Unity workflow because it allows for code based 2D game development, something I'm pretty familiar with. I have tried the 2D tools introduced in Unity 4.3, and they are great for the visual based, editor centric devs, but I like to just work in the code rather than bouncing back and forth between visual editing and scripting. Futile seems very stable, but is still in-dev like HaxeFlixel. So who knows. One minor flaw with Unity + Futile is the need to use MonoDevelop. I...tolerate MD. After using Sublime Text for so long, MD feels like a huge step back, but for now I need the code completion feature. One major con with Unity is that I fear hitting a wall far along in development which will require me to pay for a pro license. I would gladly pay for these great tools if I was making money from these games, but right now this is just a hobby and doesn't justify the $1500 price tag. HaxeFlixel is, and should always be, free.

If you have made it this far through my stream of consciousness, check out this quick demo: <a href="http://jonathanhirz.com/newShooter">newShooter</a>.

I'm using some awesome FREE art assets from <a href="http://kenney.nl">Kenney.nl</a>. This was made in Unity + Futile in just a few hours. Can't do much yet except move around and watch, but it's a start. My next step is to build the same demo in HaxeFlixel and compare the two. I honestly can't decide, and see pros and cons with each.
