No joke, this game took me months to learn when I first released in on iOS a few years ago. I was learning game programming, game design, Cocos2d, Objective-C and the iOS ecosystem all at the same time, and I think it took me 8 months to put something together. I made this version in HaxeFlixel TODAY. In one day, while watching my 4 month old son by myself. That says a lot about how far I have come, and how easy it is to build games with HaxeFlixel. =]
