title: Last month in Apple Developer Program
category: iOS
---

So I mentioned this in the last post, but I have decided to let my Apple Developer account lapse this month. It ends sometime near the end of May / early June (always right before WWDC). I would love to keep this account open, and will release games in the future for iOS (both iPhone and iPad), but for now I can't justify paying for another unprofitable year.

My plan for now is to continue to make games with free tools and hopefully use channels like itch.io to make some money and get my games out there. I might even look into flash portals as a revenue stream, but until I am making enough to bring my games to mobile, I won't be keeping that account open. I am really happy with the progress I have made with HaxeFlixel, and think I can use it to make some fun games for PC and Mac. It really is the perfect tool for me right now, and makes making games easy and fun.

On that note, if you would like to support me in this last month **you could buy my one app that is in the App Store right now, [raDial Timer](http://appstore.com/radialtimer)**. I released this little utility to almost no fanfare, and it has made about $30 in its lifetime. I would love to see a little bump in sales before I have to pull the plug. You can browse through my archive to read up on the app, or [check out the gallery](http://imgur.com/a/TQLYx) of screenshots to get an idea of how it works. So, if you can, check it out or share the link to this post and help spread the word. Thanks!
