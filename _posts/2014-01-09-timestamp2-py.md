Updated timestamp.py (my automatic timestamping plugin for Sublime Text) to work with Sublime Text 3's <strong>awesome new</strong> editing changes. I don't understand why this changed,  I'm sure it's for the best, but dang that was annoying to try and fix. I had to recruit help from <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=15109">the ST forums</a> to get this working.
