I am trying something new. I have thought about new ways to make money in game development for a while now. If I had more experience, I could do the traditional 'make game, sell game' thing. I hope to be there someday, and be able to support my family with this simple model, but it's not perfect. Right now, I am still learning how to do this, and I still look at it as a hobby. I don't depend on income from games, which frees me up to just have fun and make things that I want to make. But as I said, I would love to be able to devote more time to this, and make some money from it. So what I'm planning is a two tiered system by which you can play my games and give me money.

First off, shout out to the amazing [HaxeFlixel](http://haxeflixel.com) for being a complete, open source (and FREE) gamedev toolkit that allows for cross platform deployment of games. With this I can easily make games, and make them available everywhere. I will not shut up about HaxeFlixel. =]

I launched a **[Patreon campaign](http://patreon.com/jonathanhirz)** today. Patreon is a platform that allows content creators to accept donations from their fans on a per month or per project basis. It is different from Kickstarter in that this isn't about funding a single project and delivering a product. This is about me wanting to release free games that everyone can play, and asking for support from those who feel they want to. I set mine up as a monthly campaign for now with a low goal of $10 a month. It doesn't change the way I develop games, which is very casually, and allows people who can to donate to my development. I want this to be a low pressure system, both from my end as a developer and from your end as a donator.

My plan is to release each game I make on my website, for free. You can see the games I have released so far on my home page, as well as various prototypes I have experimented with. I don't think I will be uploading more prototypes, unless I find it really interesting and can't finish it as a game. I want to focus on making and releasing more complete games. In addition to hosting the games here, I will also have free downloads available for each game through **[itch.io](http://jonathanhirz.itch.io)**, with a **Pay What You Want** option. This allows you to donate on a per project basis rather than a monthly one, if you are more comfortable with that.

**Web versions and downloads will be free to everyone, whether you donate or not!** I want everyone to be able to play, and choose to donate if they feel like they want to.

In addition to this plan, if my Patreon campaign generates over $10 per month, then I will reactivate my Apple Developer subscription ($100 per year) and release all appropriate games on iDevices **for free!** Seriously! I say 'all appropriate' games because I can forsee making a game that wouldn't work on touch devices. Those games will be PC/Mac/Linux/Web only.

So there it is. My plan to make games, release them for the world to play, and open the pathways for players to give something back to me, and allow me to continue doing the thing I love...**MAKING GAMES!**
