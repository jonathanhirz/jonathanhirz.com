title: How To Play Final Fantasy

I recently had some twitter conversation with [@shauninman](http://twitter.com/shauninman) and [@puwexil](http://twitter.com/puwexil) about playing Final Fantasy. Shaun was doing the annual Four Job Fiesta, and Adam is a speedrunner for the Final Fantasy series, and I chimed in because I recently picked up Final Fantasy V Advance to play on my Gameboy micro. Shaun brought up a cool idea/plan that he has, where he can play the GBA cartridge on the go in his micro, and on his TV through a [Super Retro Advance Adapter](http://www.amazon.com/Retro-Bit-Super-Retro-Advance-Adapter-Nintendo/dp/B00EXPCTQQ). I thought this was a great idea, but wanted to use a Gamecube and a Gameboy Player adapter since, to me, this is a little more authentic way to play. Adam mentioned that he plays this way for his speed runs, and that he plays with a [Hori Gameboy Player Controller](http://www.amazon.com/Hori-Gameboy-Player-Controller-Indigo/dp/B00076R67C/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1405805455&sr=1-1-fkmr0&keywords=hori+gamecube+snes). These controllers are really cool, but STUPID expensive. I would love to have one but can't justify spending that much money.

So, my plan was to grab a Gamecube + Gameboy Player off eBay, and buy a [RetroUSB RetroPort adapter](http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=31&products_id=31) and play with an original SNES controller. Oops, these are discontinued. I did a little searching, and found a guy in Canada who builds [his own version of this adapter](http://www.raphnet.net/electronique/x2wii/index_en.php). Cool. He also sells just the [pre-programmed circuit board](http://www.raphnet-tech.com/products/nes2wii/index.php) used to make this conversion, so you can build this controller without the adapter.

As you can see below, this is the option I finally went with.

So now I can play Final Fantasy IV Advance and Final Fantasy V Advance (still saving up for VI Advance...) on both my Gameboy micro on the go, or on the TV with an authentic controller.
