Can you smell it? That new site smell? Mmm...
So <a href="http://namecheap.com">namecheap</a> (where I host my domain name) had an awesome cyber Monday sale, 75% off hosting. I figured it's time I finally have some real hosting instead of hobbling around with free stuff. Don't get me wrong, free is awesome, and tumblr + Dropbox works. But I would like to grow this into a business, and this seemed like a great step to take. Especially since I got 3 years of hosting for $26. Can't beat that!
