I have been building/using/fixing computers for probably 20 years now, so a lot of the information is an overview, but I&#8217;ve been wanting to get a new job lately and decided to finally make a move that will make that easier. It&#8217;s hard to explain on a resume or in an interview that you have experience when the reviewer can&#8217;t see anything on paper that backs that up. So I figure I&#8217;ll spend the <strong>few hundred dollars</strong> to get the first certification, then most likely a few more to back it up, and go from there. I&#8217;m looking at this as an investment in myself and my growing family, because the reality is we cannot survive and thrive on the income that Trader Joe&#8217;s provides.</p></div>
