title: This has been really fun
---
I have NEVER had this kind of exposure before on the web. I am usually ecstatic if my blog posts get 30 hits or if I get 1-2 retweets. Over the last two days this site has gotten almost 30,000 hits among roughly 20,000 different users due to my post <a href="http://jonathanhirz.com/macprotrash-icon/">Mac Pro Trash Icon</a>. My zip with the new Trash.app icons was downloaded over <strong>32,000 times! </strong>This is staggering to me.

I got linked on <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/259043/replace-macs-trash-icon-trashcan-mac-pro/">Cult of Mac</a> and <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/12/19/want-the-new-mac-pro-without-the-price-tag-bring-it-to-your-mac-dock/">9To5Mac</a> as well as a number of smaller blogs all around the world. My favorite part is being credited as "video game developer Jonathan Hirz" in the Cult of Mac post. So cool.

Seeing all this traffic is fun and nerve-wracking, I believe the site was down for a bit when the link hit <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6935717">Hacker News</a>. Luckily someone put up a Google cache link.

Speaking of caching, I learned last night that caching your Wordpress site is VERY IMPORTANT if you expect a lot of traffic. I certainly did not expect this, so I had to scramble to get a plugin installed. Thankfully, <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-cache/">Quick Cache</a> is very easy to set up and does it's job nicely.

Final note, I hate ads on the web, but I kinda wish I had at least one set up before this traffic hit. Might have paid for my hosting for a year (or two). =]
