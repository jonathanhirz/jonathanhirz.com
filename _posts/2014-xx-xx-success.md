What does success mean to you?
I have been trying to decide what success is for a long time. I think it is different for everyone.
Success for me isn't the same as success for you.
You need to define your goals, and if you achieve them, then you are successful.
Sometimes it helps to look back on your accomplishments, no matter how mundane they may seem to you, and realize that these things can contribute to your 'success'.
If you are always looking 'up' at others and comparing their state to your own, you will either a) never be happy with what you have or b) keep pushing yourself to improve. I think one needs to recognize what they have accomplished and what they have, but always be looking forward to the next step.
