title: Mac Pro Trash Icon

I saw this tweet today:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>How can I replace my OS X trash can icon with a small Mac Pro?</p>&mdash; Cocoanetics ï£¿ (@Cocoanetics) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cocoanetics/statuses/413184824070119424">December 18, 2013</a></blockquote>

and thought "I could make that." So I did.

I can't believe this hasn't been done already.

//edit - so I realized after posting that after a reboot, the original Trash icon is shown, but as soon as you trash something, the new ones show up. Not sure how to fix that, comment if you know how.


//edit2 - iconcache. Clear your iconcache to fix this issue. Google it.
