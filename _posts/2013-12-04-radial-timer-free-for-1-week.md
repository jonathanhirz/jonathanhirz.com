Because why not? I had plans to change some things within the app to try and monetize it, but I just don't have the time or the energy. And it felt wrong to slap ads in there and play the whole IAP game. I wouldn't want to punish the few people (mostly family and friends) who did purchase in the beginning (THANK YOU) and who continue to support me as I try and make shit that makes money. I honestly feel that for me and the stuff that I'm making right now, I would so much rather have an upfront transfer of stuff for money. For some people, and with some software, F2P/IAP/WTF works very well and feels fair, but for the overwhelming majority it just feels wrong.

Where the hell was I going with all that? I don't know. Download my shitty timer app (I'll fix the sound bug today!) and tell someone to buy it next week.
