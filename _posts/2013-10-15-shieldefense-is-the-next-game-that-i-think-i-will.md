<p>shielDefense is the next game that I think I will make. I have made a prototype for iPhone with cocos2d, but I have decided to remake and finish this game with Unity. I think it&#8217;s a pretty unique game idea that builds on established ideas. I hope that by posting about it now, I will motivate myself to finish rather than shoot myself in the foot by letting my idea out. :/</p>
<p>The basic idea is that this game plays like a twin stick shooter, but there&#8217;s no shooting. The green ring is a shield that you can spin around the ship to protect yourself from asteroids, enemies, etc. I imagine this game would play great on a touch screen, but even better on other systems with twin joysticks (Vita, OUYA, PC w/ gamepad, etc).</p>
<p>I have some more ideas for storyline for this game, and for gameplay mechanics that would make it fun to play, but I&#8217;m not releasing any of that yet. I just wanted to share something that has been on the back-burner for a while in hopes that it will push me to make it a real thing.</p>
