title: raDial Timer
---
<p>My next app is almost finished. It is called <strong>raDial Timer</strong>, and is a simple, elegant timer for your iPhone. Perfect for cooking, exercising, or Pomodoro timing&#8230;anything you need to set a timer for really.</p>
<p>I am planning on releasing either with or just before iOS 7 drops, hoping for some traction with that release. The style of my app, I think, fits perfectly with the new version of iOS, so I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;ll take off.</p>
<p>The app is simply a timer, but was an opportunity for me to design something with a little style and polish. I am now very familiar with Core Animation, maybe more than I would like to be.</p>
<p>I have submitted a version to Apple to get into the system, but I will be sending the finished version as soon as they allow uploads built with the new SDK. <em>Sources say</em> this will be happening September 10, so stay tuned.</p>
