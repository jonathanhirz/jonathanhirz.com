DEVICE 6

In a sea of free to play games designed to funnel money from your wallet in exchange for flashes of instant gratification, it’s rare to see such a well thought out, original, inspiring piece of art like DEVICE 6. If you enjoy mystery, reading, thinking…basically anything that involves more than clicking the button the game tells you to click, buy this game now.
It reminds me of the first time I played Myst. It draws you in and compels you to play just a little longer, peek around one more corner, just to unravel another small piece of the mystery.

And yes, you will be taking notes. Real life notes on a piece of paper.
