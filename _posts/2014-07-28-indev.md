I like sharing updates of what I'm working on as I work on it. I feel like it motivates me to have people see constant changes to my projects. But I'm not sure about releasing playable builds along the way. For small projects like [spaceSpuds](/games/spaceSpuds), it kind of ruins the final game, since you basically play the whole thing even on the first test build. I can see lots of small changes and tweaks, but it's hard to describe them, even in a changelog. I think for larger projects with more and more content added with each release, it is perfect to have lots of people play and give their feedback. I would love to share, and I'll still do it to some extent, but I think I'll just be toning it back a little bit.

On the other hand, I did get some valuable feedback about the control scheme in spaceSpuds just from having another developer play the game for a few minutes. So I can't completely disregard the value in this.
