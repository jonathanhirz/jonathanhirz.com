<p>Since I&#8217;m lazy, I&#8217;m not going to bother bring my old posts to tumblr. I might have some energy to copy/paste/reformat them, but not today. If you need, the link is <a href="http://jonathan.roon.io">http://jonathan.roon.io</a></p>
<p>// so I did that thing I said I wasn&#8217;t going to do, and copied a <em>few </em>posts from roon over to this page. Only a few though, since it only took about 5 minutes.</p>
