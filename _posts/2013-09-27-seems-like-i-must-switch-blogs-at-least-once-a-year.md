title: Seems like I must switch blogs at least once a year...
---
<p>I like the simplicity of <a href="http://jonathan.roon.io">Roon</a>, but with that of course comes restrictions. I want a place where I can write blog posts and also have a page that links to Unity games I am making.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I’m learning Unity now.</p>
<p>So with tumblr, I can have a simple blog, and also a static page that has pictures/links to hosted Unity games to show off. For now, I’ll just use Dropbox to host, but if more that 5 people play a game I make, I might have to look for something else.</p>
